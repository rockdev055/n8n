# n8n Documentation

This is the documentation of n8n, a free and open [fair-code](http://faircode.io) licensed node-based Workflow Automation Tool.

It covers everything from setup to usage and development. It is still a work in progress and all contributions are welcome.


## What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced nodemation) helps you to interconnect every app with an API in the world with each other to share and manipulate its data without a single line of code. It is an easy to use, user-friendly and highly customizable service, which uses an intuitive user interface for you to design your unique workflows very fast. Hosted on your server and not based in the cloud, it keeps your sensible data very secure in your own trusted database.
