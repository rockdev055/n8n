![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/docs/images/n8n-logo.png)

n8n is a free node based "Open Source" (with Commons Clause)
Workflow Automation Tool. It can be self-hosted, easily extended, and
so also used with internal tools.

Is still in beta so can not guarantee that everything works perfectly. Also
is there currently not much documentation. That will hopefully change soon.



## Demo

A short demo (< 3 min) which shows how to create a simple workflow which
automatically sends a new Slack notification every time a Github repository
received or lost a star:
