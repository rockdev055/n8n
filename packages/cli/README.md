![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://n8n.io/n8n-logo.png)

n8n is a tool which allows to easily and fast automate different taks.

Is still in beta so can not guarantee that everything works perfectly. Also
is there currently not much documentation. That will hopefully change soon.


## Give n8n a spin

To simply spin up n8n to have a look and give it spin you can simply run:

```
npx n8n
```

It will then download everything which is needed and start n8n.

You can then access n8n by opening:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)


## Installation

To fully install n8n globally execute:

```
npm install n8n -g
```

After the installation n8n can be started by simply typing in:
```
n8n
```

## Development

When developing n8n can be started with `npm run start:dev`.
It will then automatically restart n8n every time a file changes.
